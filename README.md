# Casual TNH
This mod I've made for H3VR does the following when playing take and hold game mode:
1. Allows you to multiply amount of tokens you earn(configurable in .cfg file).
2. Allows you to change required time for encryptions to appear(configurable in .cfg file).
3. Allows you to reroll items for free(can be enabled or disabled in .cfg file).
4. Allows you to change cost of upgrading magazines(configurable in .cfg file).
5. Allows you to change cost of cloning magazines(configurable in .cfg file).

Note: This mod was written on 16/10/2023.
If it doesn't work game might have received updates so mod might need to be updated as well.
